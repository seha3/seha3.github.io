	<h1>Welcome to Silvis first website</h1>
	<h2>hola // hello </h2>
<p>Hey guys! I'm Silvia and I'm a pocha so a lot of spanglish will be going on in here</p>
<p>I make music and recently I decided to make a twist in my life so I beggin in this amazing trip of learning how to code, this will be my first project ever! so I'm very excited but also scared of not doing a great job</p>
<p>I'm currently studing in a program at Mexico City called HolaCode. It is one of a kind opportunity that this guys are bringing to a very special community, the migrants and deportees community.</p>
<p>So, hope you travel with me in this incredible journey, I'm gonna be sharing with you all this new techniques in coding but also music and stuff that I like</p>
<h2>You can listen to some of my music down here:</h2>
